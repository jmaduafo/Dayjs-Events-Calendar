# Dayjs-Events-Calendar

## Description

In this application, my goal is to construct the logic for a work calendar that accounts for events in the past, the event that's currently taking place, and the events that will take place. I also made sure to keep the events rendered on the apllication even after refresh so that the user's inputs are saved even after a revisit.

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
