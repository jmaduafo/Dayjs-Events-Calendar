# Dayjs-Events-Calendar

## Description

In this application, my goal is to construct the logic for a work calendar that accounts for events in the past, the event that's currently taking place, and the events that will take place. I also made sure to keep the events rendered on the apllication even after refresh so that the user's inputs are saved even after a revisit.

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Usage

Deployed application:

https://jmaduafo.github.io/Dayjs-Events-Calendar/Develop/


For events in the past, the textarea box is gray, for the present, the textarea would be fully red, and events 
in the future would be green. In this case, since it is past 8 PM, all events in the calendar are in the past, 
thus they are all grayed out

In this demo, it shows how the events are saved even after refresh.
